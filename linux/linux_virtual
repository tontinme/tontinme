#difference between lxc & lvm
    The main difference between the KVM virtualization and Linux Containers is that
	  virtual machines require a separate kernel instance to run on, while containers
    	  can be deployed from the host operating system. This significantly reduces the 
    	  complexity of container creation and maintenance. Also, the reduced overhead lets
    	  you create a large number of containers with faster startup and shutdown speeds.
    	  Both Linux Containers and KVM virtualization have certain advantages and drawbacks
    	  that influence the use cases in which these technologies are typically applied:

    1) KVM virtualization

    KVM virtualization lets you boot full operating systems of different kinds, even non-Linux systems.
	  However, a complex setup is sometimes needed. Virtual machines are resource-intensive 
	  so you can run only a limited number of them on your host machine.
    Running separate kernel instances generally means better separation and security. If one of
	  the kernels terminates unexpectedly, it does not disable the whole system. On the other hand,
	  this isolation makes it harder for virtual machines to communicate with the rest of the system,
	  and therefore several interpretation mechanisms must be used.
    Guest virtual machine is isolated from host changes, which lets you run different versions
	  of the same application on the host and virtual machine. KVM also provides many useful
	  features such as live migration. For more information on these capabilities, see
	  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Virtualization Deployment and Administration Guide.

    2) Linux Containers:

    The current version of Linux Containers is designed primarily to support isolation of one
	  or more applications, with plans to implement full OS containers in the near future.
	  You can create or destroy containers very easily and they are convenient to maintain.
    System-wide changes are visible in each container. For example, if you upgrade an
	  application on the host machine, this change will apply to all sandboxes that run instances of this application.
    Since containers are lightweight, a large number of them can run simultaneously on a
	  host machine. The theoretical maximum is 6000 containers and 12,000 bind mounts of
	  root file system directories. Also, containers are faster to create and have low startup times.
